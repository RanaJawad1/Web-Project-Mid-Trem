                Dubai
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Dubai, also spelled Dubayy, city and capital of the emirate of Dubai, one of the wealthiest of the seven
                emirates that constitute the federation of the United Arab Emirates, which was created in 1971 following
                independence from Great Britain. There are several theories about the origin of the name Dubai. One
                associates it with the daba—a type of locust that infests the area—while another holds that it refers to
                a market that existed near the city. In recent years Dubai has been compared to Singapore and Hong Kong
                and is often regarded as the Middle East’s premier entrepôt. Area 13.5 square miles (35 square km). Pop.
                (2017 est.) 2,919,178.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Dubai is a city of skyscrapers, ports, and beaches, where big business takes place alongside sun-seeking
                tourism. Because of its large expatriate population, it feels like a Middle Eastern melting pot, and the
                atmosphere is generally tolerant. Religious affiliations are not a prominent aspect of city life. Islam
                is the majority religion, but churches and Hindu temples coexist with Dubai’s mosques.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The western area of Dubai benefits from small stretches of sandy beaches, which have helped to catalyze
                the city’s tourism industry. Dubai’s rulers have sought to increase the city’s limited seafronts, and,
                in the absence of natural offshore islands, developers were encouraged to construct giant man-made
                islands off the coast of the city. The most famous of these is Palm Jumeirah, which has the shape of a
                palm tree. Others include the “World” islands, a cluster of small islands positioned to resemble a world
                map when viewed from above.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Dubai’s population has grown steadily over the past two centuries, from just a few thousand local
                inhabitants to well over two million. Most of the early population increases were due to merchants from
                neighbouring countries choosing to relocate to Dubai’s business-friendly environment. In the later 20th
                century the city’s construction boom led to a huge increase in the number of South Asian labourers and
                an influx of skilled expatriates from all over the world who play an important role in Dubai’s
                multi-sector economy. Expatriates in the city vastly outnumber native Emiratis. With the exception of
                the labourers, who are housed in work camps beyond the city limits, expatriates of various nationalities
                are spread across Dubai. Although Arabic is the official language, English is, in practice, the lingua
                franca.

            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The city, best known as the location of the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, or the shrines of Imam Husayn and Abbas,[8][9] is considered a holy city for Shia Muslims, in the same way as Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. Tens of millions of Shi'ite Muslims visit the site twice a year, rivaling Mecca and Mashhad by the number of pilgrims annually.[10][11][12][13] The martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali is commemorated annually by millions of Shi'ites.[10][11][12][14] Up to 8 million pilgrims visit the city to observe ʿĀshūrāʾ (the tenth day of the month of Muharram), which marks the anniversary of Husayn's death, but the main event is the Arbaʿīn (the 40th day after 'Ashura'), where up to 30 million visit the graves. 
                Most of the pilgrims travel on foot from all around Iraq and more than 56 countries.[15]
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The urban area is divided into eight zones: administrative, diplomatic, residential, institutional,
                industrial, and commercial areas, a greenbelt, and a national park. It includes an Olympic village and
                gardens and dairy, poultry, and vegetable farms, as well as such institutions as the Atomic Research
                Institute and the National Health Centre. The name Karbala was chosen to reflect the country’s
                ideology.

                Istanbul
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, is the largest city in Turkey, serving as the country's
                economic, cultural and historic hub. The city straddles the Bosporus strait, lying in both Europe and
                Asia, and has a population of over 15 million residents, comprising 19% of the population of Turkey.
                Istanbul is the most populous European city, and the world's 15th-largest city.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The city was founded as Byzantium in the 7th century BCE by Greek settlers from Megara.
                In 330 CE, the Roman emperor Constantine the Great made it his imperial capital, renaming it first as
                New Rome and then as Constantinople after himself. The city
                grew in size and influence, eventually becoming a beacon of the Silk Road and one of the most important
                cities in history.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The city served as an imperial capital for almost 1600 years: during the Roman/Byzantine,
                Latin, late Byzantine, and Ottoman empires. The city played a
                key role in the advancement of Christianity during Roman/Byzantine times, hosting four of the first
                seven ecumenical councils before its transformation to an Islamic stronghold following the Fall of
                Constantinople in 1453 CE—especially after becoming the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate in 1517.

                London
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                London, city, capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the oldest of the world’s great cities—its
                history spanning nearly two millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain’s largest
                metropolis, it is also the country’s economic, transportation, and cultural centre.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                London is situated in southeastern England, lying astride the River Thames some 50 miles (80 km)
                upstream from its estuary on the North Sea. In satellite photographs the metropolis can be seen to sit
                compactly in a Green Belt of open land, with its principal ring highway (the M25 motorway) threaded
                around it at a radius of about 20 miles (30 km) from the city centre. The growth of the built-up area
                was halted by strict town planning controls in the mid-1950s. Its physical limits more or less
                correspond to the administrative and statistical boundaries separating the metropolitan county of
                Greater London from the “home counties” of Kent, Surrey, and Berkshire (in clockwise order) to the south
                of the river and Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, and Essex to the north. The historic counties of Kent,
                Hertfordshire, and Essex extend in area beyond the current administrative counties with the same names
                to include substantial parts of the metropolitan county of Greater London, which was formed in 1965.
                Most of Greater London south of the Thames belongs to the historic county of Surrey, while most of
                Greater London north of the Thames belongs historically to the county of Middlesex. Area Greater London,
                607 square miles (1,572 square km). Pop. (2001) Greater London, 7,172,091; (2011 prelim.) Greater
                London, 8,173,941.

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                The population of London already exceeded one million by 1800. A century later it reached 6.5 million.
                The city’s physical expansion was not constrained either by military defenses (a highly influential
                factor on continental Europe) or by the intervention of state power (so evident in the town planning of
                Paris, Vienna, Rome, and other capitals of continental Europe). Although much of the land around London
                was owned by the aristocracy, the church, and other institutions with feudal roots, its development was
                the work of unfettered capitalism driven by the housing demands of the rising middle class. Free-ranging
                building speculation engulfed villages and small towns over an ever-widening radius with each
                improvement in transport technology and purchasing power. The solidly built-up area of London measured
                some 5 miles (8 km) from east to west in 1750, 15 miles (24 km) in 1850, and 30 miles (50 km) in 1950.

                Lahore
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Lahore (/ləˈhɔːr/; Punjabi: لہور [lᵊɔ̀ːɾᵊ]; Urdu: لاہور; [lɑːˈɦɔːɾ] (listen)) is the capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab, is Pakistan's 2nd largest city after Karachi, and is the 26th largest city in the world.
                [14] Lahore is one of Pakistan's wealthiest cities with an estimated GDP (PPP) of $84 billion as of 2019

            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                It is the largest city and historic cultural centre of the greater Punjab region,[15][16][17][18] 
                and is one of Pakistan's most socially liberal,[19] progressive,[20] and cosmopolitan cities.[21]
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Lahore's origins reach into antiquity. The city has been controlled by numerous empires throughout the course of its history, including the Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, and Delhi Sultanate by the medieval era. Lahore reached the height of its splendour under the Mughal Empire between the late 16th and early 18th century and served as its capital city for many years. The city was captured by the forces of the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah in 1739, then fell into a period of decay while being contested between the Afghans and the Sikhs.
                 Lahore eventually became the capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th century and regained some of its lost grandeur.[22
                

                The third Wittelsbach who left his mark on the community was Louis I, king
                of Bavaria from 1825 to 1848. Louis planned and created modern Munich, and his architects established
                the city’s characteristic appearance in the public buildings they designed. The 19th century was
                Munich’s greatest period of growth and development. Protestants became citizens for the first time in
                what had been until then a purely Roman Catholic town. The city’s population of 100,000 in 1854 grew to
                500,000 by 1900. Munich’s cultural importance in Europe was enhanced when Louis II, by his championing
                of the composer Richard Wagner, revived its fame as a city of music and the stage.
