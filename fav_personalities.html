                Syed Shehanshah Hussain Naqvi has underlined the need for the Muslims to forge unity, putting aside
                their differences to successfully fail the agendas of imperialist forces.
                He has emphasized the need for unity and fraternity among Sunni-Shia Muslims.

                Elon Musk

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Elon Musk is working to revolutionize transportation both on Earth, through electric car maker Tesla --
                and in space, via rocket producer SpaceX.
                He owns 21% of Tesla but has pledged more than half his stake as collateral for loans; Forbes has
                discounted his stake to take the loans into account.
                Twitter's board agreed to sell the company to Musk for $44 billion on April 25, 2022, after he disclosed
                a 9.1% stake and threatened a hostile takeover.
                SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, is valued at $100 billion after a funding round in December 2021.
                He grew up in South Africa, then immigrated to Canada at age 17. He landed in the U.S. as a transfer
                student to the University of Pennsylvania.

                Imran Khan Niazi
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Few would dispute that Imran was the finest cricketer Pakistan has produced, or the biggest heartthrob.
                Suave, erudite and monstrously talented, he gave cricket in the subcontinent real sex appeal in the
                1970s and 1980s. As such he and TV completed the popularisation of the game in his country which Hanif
                Mohammad and the radio had begun. Thousands, if not millions, who had never dreamt of bowling fast on
                heartless baked mud suddenly wanted to emulate Imran and his lithe bounding run, his leap and his
                reverse-swinging yorker. He also made himself into an allrounder worth a place for his batting alone,
                and captained Pakistan as well as anyone, rounding off his career with the 1992 World Cup. He played
                hardly any domestic cricket in Pakistan: instead he just flew in for home series from Worcestershire or
                Sussex, or rather from the more fashionable London salons. His averages (37 with the bat, 22 with the
                ball) put him at the top of the quartet of allrounders (Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee and Kapil Dev being
                the others) who dominated Test cricket in the 1980s. And whereas Botham declined steadily, Imran just
                got better and better: in his last 10 years of international cricket he played 51 Tests, averaging a
                sensational 50 with the bat and 19 with the ball. He gave no quarter during some memorable battles with
                West Indies - Pakistan drew three series with them at a time when everybody else was being bounced out
                of sight - and he led Pakistan to their first series victory in England in 1987, taking 10 for 77 with
                an imperious display in the decisive victory at Headingley. After retirement he remained a high-profile
                figure, with his marriage - and subsequent split with - the socialite Jemima Goldsmith and a move into
                the labyrinthine world of Pakistan politics.

                Steve Jobs
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Apple cofounder Steve Jobs finally succumbed to cancer at the age of 56 on October 5th, leaving behind a
                legacy that changed the computer, music, film and wireless industries. His once written-off tech company
                in August briefly topped ExxonMobil as the most valuable U.S. corporation. In that month he resigned as
                CEO. The Reed College dropout founded Apple in his garage. Jobs created the Macintosh in 1976 and was
                fired 9 years later after a power struggle with Chief Exec John Sculley. He returned to Apple in 1996.
                At the time of his death most of his wealth still came from Disney, due to Disney's purchase of Pixar in
                2006; as the largest individual shareholder, he owned about $4.47 billion of Disney stock.

                Tom Cruise
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Tom Cruise (born July 3, 1962, Syracuse, New York, U.S.), is an American actor who emerged in the 1980s
                as one of Hollywood’s most popular leading men, known for his clean-cut
                good looks and versatility.

                Cruise, who took up acting in high school, made his film debut in Endless Love (1981). He had supporting
                roles in such movies as Taps (1981) and The Outsiders (1983) before starring as a high-school senior who
                turns his parents’ home into a brothel in Risky Business (1983). The movie was a major success, earning
                Cruise widespread recognition. His star status was cemented with Top Gun (1986), the highest-grossing
                film of that year, in which he played a navy jet pilot. In 1986 Cruise appeared opposite Paul Newman in
                The Color of Money, which was directed by Martin Scorsese, and two years later starred as an autistic
                man’s selfish brother in Rain Man. For his portrayal of a Vietnam War veteran turned activist in Born on
                the Fourth of July (1989), Cruise received his first Academy Award nomination.
