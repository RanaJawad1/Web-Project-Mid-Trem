                Bādshāhī Mosque
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The Badshahi Mosque is a Mughal-era congregational mosque in Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province
                of Punjab, Pakistan. The mosque is located west of Lahore Fort along the outskirts of the Walled City of
                Lahore, and is widely considered to be one
                of Lahore's most iconic landmarks.

                The Badshahi Mosque was constructed by the sixth Mughal emperor Aurangzeb between 1671
                and 1673 and was the largest mosque in the world from 1673 to 1986. The mosque is an important example
                of Mughal architecture, with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay.
                It remains the largest mosque of the Mughal-era, and is the third-largest mosque in Pakistan. After
                the fall of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was used as a garrison by the British Empire, and is now one
                of Pakistan's most iconic sights.

                Niagara Falls
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge,
                spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United
                States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, also known as the Canadian Falls, which straddles
                the international border of the two countries. The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie
                within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from
                American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York.

                Formed by the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, the combined falls have the
                highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50 m.
                During peak daytime tourist hours, more than 168,000 m3 of water goes over the crest
                of the falls every minute. Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America, as
                measured by flow rate. Niagara Falls is famed for its beauty and is a valuable source of
                hydroelectric power. Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for
                the stewards of the falls since the 19th century.

                Palm Jumeirah
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The Palm Jumeirah is an archipelago of artificial islands in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, created
                using land reclamation which extends into the Persian Gulf. It is part of a larger series of
                developments called the Palm Islands, including Palm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira, which, when completed,
                will together increase Dubai's shoreline by a total of 520 kilometres. It has an estimated
                population of at least 10,000 as of 2017. It is located on the Jumeirah coastal area of the emirate
                of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. The construction was done as a joint venture by two Dutch
                specialist companies, Van Oord and Boskalis. The same companies also created The World. The recently
                opened destinations The Pointe, Club Vista Mare and Nakheel Mall are the latest additions to Palm
                Jumeirah.

                Kalaash Valley
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The Kalaash Valley are valleys in Chitral District in northern Pakistan. The valleys are surrounded by
                the Hindu Kush mountain range. The inhabitants of the valley are the Kalash people, who have a unique
                culture, language and follow a form of ancient Hinduism. As such, the Kalasha Valleys are a source of
                attraction for Pakistanis as well as International tourists. There are three main valleys. The largest
                and most populous valley is Bumburet, reached by a road from Ayun in the Kunar Valley. Rumbur is a side
                valley north of Bumburet. The third valley, Biriu, is a side valley of the Kunar Valley south of
                Bumburet.

                The Kalash people are a small religious and ethnic minority of Pakistan. The Kalash religion is
                polytheist faith similar to ancient forms of Hinduism and the people offer sacrifices for their gods.
                Their culture is interlinked with their religion and includes several unique festivals and celebrations.
                The people generally do not intermarry or cohabit regions with local Muslims but neither are they
                hostile towards them. The people are under legal and constitutional protection of the State of Pakistan
                as a scheduled tribe.

                Lake Saiful Muluk
            </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Saiful Muluk is a mountainous lake located at the northern end of the Kaghan Valley, near the town of
                Naran in the Saiful Muluk National Park. At an elevation of 3,224 m above sea level, the lake is located
                above the tree line, and is one of the highest lakes in Pakistan.

                Saiful Muluk was formed by glacial moraines that blocked the water of the stream passing through the
                valley. The Kaghan Valley was formed in the greater Pleistocene Period dating back almost 300,000
                years when the area was covered with ice. Rising temperatures and receding glaciers left a large
                depression where glaciers once stood. Melting water collected into the lake.

                The Lake Saiful Muluk is named after a legendary prince. A fairy tale called Saif-ul-Muluk, written by
                the Sufi poet Mian Muhammad Bakhsh, talks of the lake. It tells the story of the Egyptian Prince
                Saiful Malook who fell in love with a fairy princess named Princess Badri-ul-Jamala at the lake.
